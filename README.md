A simple flake which allows you to easily use the everforest theme in you config. 
Chose type(light/dark) and variant(hard/medium/soft) with the the following options 
```
colorschemes.everforest.type = "dark" #default
colorschemes.everfores.variant = "medium" # default
```

## Colors
You may access the colors 
## Presets
I will throw together some presets for everything i use myself, and am willing to add others as well. 
To use something like foot, just do ``programs.foot.colors = config.colorschemes.everforest.foot`` once you have imported the flake module.
