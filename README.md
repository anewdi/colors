A simple flake which allows you to easily use the everforest theme in you config. 

## Presets
I will throw together some presets for everything i use myself, and am willing to add others as well. 
To use something like foot, just do ``programs.foot.colors = config.colorschemes.everforest.foot`` once you have imported the flake module.
